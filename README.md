# USB-Rubber-Ducky




The USB rubber ducky is a powerful tool that can be used for both malicious and benign purposes. This project focuses on utilizing the capabilities of the USB rubber ducky for productive purposes, by creating a custom device that automates routine tasks and simplifies workflows on a target computer. The device will be programmed to execute a sequence of keystrokes and mouse actions, which can be easily configured to meet specific needs.Â 

The creation of the custom USB rubber ducky involves programming the device using a scripting language, and physically constructing the device to resemble a standard USB drive. The project outcome will be a fully functional USB rubber ducky that can be used to automate a variety of tasks, including data entry, file management, and software testing.




The USB rubber ducky is a hardware device that can be used to automate repetitive tasks and simplify processes on a target computer. Despite its usefulness, these devices can also be used for malicious purposes, such as bypassing security measures, installing malware, and stealing sensitive information.
The main challenge with the USB rubber ducky is ensuring that it is used in a secure and controlled manner, without posing a threat to the target computer or its users. There is a need for a custom USB rubber ducky that can be used for educational and research purposes, while also addressing the security concerns associated with these devices.
